This spreadsheet contains a structured set of checklists and test cases developed by Daniel Eduardo Tovias Alan√≠s as part of a QA (Quality Assurance) strategy. It is organized into five main sections:

- Artefacts: Mind map of the functionality to be tested.

- Checklist: General application verifications across browsers (Opera, Chrome).

- Data Validation: Boundary testing and equivalence class input validation.

- Test Cases: Detailed test cases with steps, expected results, and bug report links.


Checklist 2: Specific API verification (methods, requests, and validations).

This file showcases the use of key QA techniques such as equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, negative testing, and API validation.
